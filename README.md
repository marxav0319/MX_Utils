## Description

This repository holds a collection of methods written in Python that have been useful to my work.
Currently it holds methods under the following sub-headings:

+ Document Preperation
  + Creating latex resources (strings and files)
  + Compiling latex resources (requires pdflatex in PATH)
  + Merging PDF files
+ Database reading
  + Reading a SQL table into memory as a `pandas.DataFrame`
  + Exporting REDCap records
  + Downloading files via SFTP
+ Mailing
  + Send emails via Microsoft Outlook programmatically.

This repository is actively under development, however there's enough in here for now for me to
start using this as my library of generic methods.
